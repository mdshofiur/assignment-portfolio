            <p>Having large amounts of vitamin A can harm your unborn baby. So if you're pregnant or thinking about having a baby, do not eat liver or liver products, such as pâté, because these are very high in vitamin A. Also avoid taking supplements that contain vitamin A. Speak to your GP or midwife if you would like more information.</p>
